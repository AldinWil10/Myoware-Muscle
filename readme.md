# Definition
The effleurage technique is a non-pharmacological method that has been proven to be effective in reducing pain levels by stimulating tactile skin fibers which can inhibit pain signals and stop the spread of pain to the cerebral cortex which causes a decrease in pain. Effleurage massage can also stimulate an increase in oxytocin and endogenous production which can speed up labor with uterine contractions. Effleurage massage is usually recommended by health workers to be carried out by families accompanying birthing patients. By looking at this function, the development team is trying to combine the effleurage technique with the Internet of Things, where the effleurage technique will utilize Myoware muscle sensor reading data so that it can run automatically. Data from sensor readings in the form of muscle contraction values will later be sent via the Arduino UNO microcontroller with the help of ESP-01 so that it can be displayed via a mobile application or on the Blynk website.
